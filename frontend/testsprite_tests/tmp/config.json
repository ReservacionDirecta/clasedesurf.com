Specifically, verify the user flow in the reservation confirmation page works correctly when: 1) A user proceeds as a guest, 2) A user logs in at Step 1, and 3) A user attempts to book as a guest with an email that already exists (checking for the correct prompt to log in). Also, ensure the page reload fix for auto-login after guest registration is successful without a full page navigation.",
